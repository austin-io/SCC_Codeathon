Codeathon Problem description:

A student came to me with their future schedule plan for graduating from SCC with a degree in computer science.  According to their schedule they were supposed to take CISP 310 this Spring and CISP 430 in the fall.  

The problem?  We usually offer CISP 310 in the Fall and CISP 430 in the Spring.  If this student had known this sooner they could have taken CISP 310 last fall and still graduated on time, but now they are in danger of losing financial aid and up to a whole year of potential salary.  

Your task, create a easy to use (and visually pleasing) program that will generate a graduation schedule for CISP classes that matches the historical data available and takes into account what the student has already taken and what they still need to take to graduate.  

Once you have the basic problem solved, please consider the following:
Is there more than one path they could take?  How will you tell them their choices?
Have you considered prerequisite courses?
What if they wanted to switch from a degree to a certificate?
How could you give them the option of Summer classes?
What if the historical data is not consistent, how will you weight it?
What if they wanted to take classes at ARC?
What if they only want to take in person classes?
What if they only want to take online classes?

Input files: 
Historical data: cisp-sem-year.txt (eg. cisp-sp-2018.txt would have the CISP courses offered at SCC this semester).  
Courses taken: w1234567.txt (example students labeled by their wID number)
Courses needed for major or certificate: abbrev.txt (eg. ascs.txt would have the courses required for an AS in CS, if more than one course is on a line then it is one or the other).
